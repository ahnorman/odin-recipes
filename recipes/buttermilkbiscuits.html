        <p>Biscuit recipe from my favorite recipe website. The kids love to have these with nutella. Original recipe here: <a href="https://www.smittenkitchen.com/2013/03/my-favorite-buttermilk-biscuits/">Smitten Kitchen's favorite buttermilk biscuit recipe</a></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/4 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons to 1 1/2 tablespoons (10 to 20 grams) sugar (to taste, see note above)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15 grams) baking powder</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon (5 grams) table salt</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>9 tablespoons (125 grams) chilled unsalted butter, cut into small chunks</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (175 ml) buttermilk</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>              
                <li>Heat oven to 400 °F and cover baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large, wide bowl. Using fingertips or a pastry blender, work butter into dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse meal, Add buttermilk and stir until large, craggy clumps form. Reach hands into bowl and knead mixture briefly until it just holds together.</li>
                <li>To form biscuit rounds: Transfer dough to floured counter and pat out until 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick (err on the thin side if uncertain, as the tall ones will literally rise and then tip over, like mine did the day I photographed these). Using a round cutter (2 inches for regular sized biscuits, 3 inches for the monstrous ones shown above), press straight down — twisting produces less layered sides — and transfer rounds to prepared sheet, spacing two inches apart.</li>
                <li>To make drop biscuits: Drop 1/4-cup spoonfuls onto baking sheet, spacing two inches apart.</li> 
                <li>Both methods:Bake until biscuits are golden brown on top, about 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly, then serve warm, with butter/jam/eggs/bacon/sausage and gravy or any combination thereof. Happy weekend! </li>
            </ol>
